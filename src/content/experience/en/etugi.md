This was my first freelance project, which allowed me to apply and significantly improve my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I focused on creating a visually appealing and clean interface from scratch.

While the user interface was well-received, the underlying code was largely written by hand. As a result, my code was a bit "spaghetti-like," lacking the best practices I've learned since. Despite this, the project was invaluable. It was the crucial experience that helped me completely master the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
