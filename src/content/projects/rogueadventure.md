This is a 2D pixel platformer game project created as part of my coursework. Rogue Adventure is a small platformer that helped me apply my knowledge and gain a deeper understanding of the development process.
<br>
Although it was a group project, I was responsible for over 95% of the work. I used Unity and C# to build core features like a flexible player control system, character animations, and a level design workflow. This project was a solid starting point, allowing me to independently research and optimize a 2D game's performance.
